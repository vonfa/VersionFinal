# VersionFinal

FINAL VERSION OF THE PROJECT

The final version of the project must be accompanied by a final video (5 minutes maximum) showing how the game works. In this case, the video should serve to impress the audience. This video has to be useful, for example, to motivate future students at the beginning of the course. The video should be made by the group member who had only made one video so far.

This version should appear in the group's GitHub repository tagged with the tag VersionFinal. The project should contain the following files:

The .sql file to create the database
The #C project with the client
The .c file with the server
